# Discord Token Checker 

Discord Token Checker is a powerful Discord token checker that verifies tokens and extracts account information. It validates tokens while collecting data on email/phone verification status, server memberships, Nitro subscriptions, billing details, and creation dates. Features include both sequential and turbo (parallel) processing modes, proxy support with auto-rotation, categorized results in organized output files, and a user-friendly interface with color-coded output and progress tracking.

## 📋 How to Use

### Setup
1. Run the tool first - it will automatically create the necessary folder structure
2. Add your tokens to input/tokens.txt (one token per line)
3. (Recommended) Add proxies to input/proxies.txt (one proxy per line) to avoid rate limits

## 📁 Output Files

The tool generates the following output files:

- `outputs/valid_tokens.txt` - All valid tokens
- `outputs/invalid_tokens.txt` - All invalid tokens
- `outputs/detailed_tokens.txt` - Detailed information for each valid token
